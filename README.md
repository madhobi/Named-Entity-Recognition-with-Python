# Clinical Named Entity Recognition with Python and spaCy
Here, I am working with a dataset containing medical notes. I have focused on named entity recognition (ner) task using Spacy (Python library). The dataset
is publicly available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/finalepoch/medical-ner/data

I have attached two notebooks here:
- In the first notebook, I did some data exploration
- In the second notebook, I used Spacy to recognize medically relevant entity.
